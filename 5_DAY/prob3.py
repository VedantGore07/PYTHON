# Q5. 5. Create a base class called Person with a constructor that 
# takes a name as a parameter. Create a derived class called Student 
# that inherits from Person and has a constructor 
# that takes a parameter called grade. Write a method 
# in student to display the name and grade of the student. 
# Use Super keyword to achieve this.


class Person():
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self,name,grade):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.grade = grade

    def display(self):
        print(self.name, self.grade)

s1 = Student("Suman", "A")
s1.display()
