File handling in python

two types of files -->
t --> text file
b --> binary file (wont be in a readable format. images)

file operation -->
open 
read
write
close

f1 = open("file_1.txt","x")
x == Mode

six types of modes -->
r  --> read mode
w  --> write  ( opens the file in write mode only, it overwrites the file if file alrady exists or create a new file if file does not exists the file  file handler exists at the beginning)
a  --> append ( opens the file in append/write mode. file handler exists at the end of the file (if file is alrady exists))


r+ --> opens the file in both read and write mode. file handler exists at the beginning...
        I/O error if file does not exists.

w+ --> opens the file in both read and write mode. file handler exists at the beginning...
        overwrites the previous content of the opened file if the file already exists. it creates a new
        file if no file exists.

a+ -->
